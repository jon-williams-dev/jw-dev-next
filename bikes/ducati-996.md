Ducati 996 Monoposto. Bought from a Ducati enthusiast. Belts and all oils were replaced last year.

The 916 presented in 1994 was matched to the 996cc superbike factory racer from 1999, Carl Fogarty won the 1998 superbike world title on this bike. The Ducati 996 was born.

With several improvements and about 10 hp more than the 916, this is again a super sports machine. According to many it is the most beautiful bike ever built and already a true classic. But more than that, it's a pleasure to drive. Great roadholding and razor sharp steering characterise the 996.

This 996 is in good condition. The upper fairing is damaged (see photo) but an extra one is included.
It starts, drives, runs, steers and brakes as it should.
Various accessories such as:
- Termignoni exhaust system
- Adjustable brake-shift set, with reversed shift
- Ohlins suspension
- Brembo brakes

I would certainly recommend you to come and have a look at the bike so you can see with your own eyes if this 20-year-old superbike meets your expectations.
