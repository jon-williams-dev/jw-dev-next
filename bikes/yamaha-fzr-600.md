This FZR is already 32 years old! I bought it in Holland and it has had only 2 owners.

I bought the bike as a project but, due to lack of time (and too many other projects) have decided to sell it to (hopefully) someone who can invest more time and love into the bike. 

In my opinion this is the coolest FZR-600 wearing the rounded headlinghts and in the best (cult-classic) color being the main reasons I initially bought this bike. 

The bike is in an average (used) condition expected for its age and mileage, is clean and is equipped with a "sporty" exhaust. The tyres and battery are good. Unfortunatly, the fairings have some damage (see photos).

Im open to offers on thie bike due to the fairing damage and relativly high mileage (34k Miles).
