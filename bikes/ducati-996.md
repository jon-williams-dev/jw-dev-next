header: A usable Ducati 996 that needs to be ridden. 
quote: The 916 presented in 1994 was matched to the 996cc superbike factory racer from 1999, Carl Fogarty won the 1998 superbike world title on this bike. The Ducati 996 was born. With several improvements and about 10 hp more than the 916, this is again a super sports machine. According to many it is the most beautiful bike ever built and already a true classic. But more than that, it's a pleasure to drive. Great roadholding and razor sharp steering characterise the 996.

A Ducati 996 to ride and enjoy! 

It's not perfect and is an a used condition so is a good example of a 996 to get out and have fun on. It starts, drives, runs, steers and brakes as it should - and sounds amazing.

I bought the bike in Holland (although is currently registered in Germany) with the plan to ride it, but unfortunately I have used it a lot less than expected, and therefore want to find it a better home where it can be appreciated as it should. 

When I bought the bike, it came with little information and history. Due to this and the KM of the bike (57k), I have invested quite some time and money into the bike to get it to the standard that it should be and that im happy with. 

Some of the work includes: 
- Full Service
- Lubricants and auxiliaries, sealing rings, gaskets, various screws, nuts etc. 
- Oil/filter change (Motul 300V Factory 15W50)
- Petrol Filter
- Air Filter (Pipercross performance)
- Spark plugs (CHAMPION RA59GC)
- Coolent change (MOTUL Motocool)
- Timing Belt
- New tyres, Michelin Pilot Power, front (120/70ZR17 and rear 1(80/55ZR17)
- Fork Seals
- BOS silencer insert 748-998 

The bike is 20 years old and has some signs of "wear and tear" (expected for the age, mileage and usage). The upper fairing has some damaged but an extra fairing is included (see photos).

This example has some nice bits including Termignoni (carbon) pipes (including a DB Killer that can be removed), adjustable brake-shift set with reversed shift, Brembo brakes and an Ohlins rear shock. 
The bike has also had the (now quite common) conversion from a "biposto" to a "monoposto" making it more appealing and look even more "sporty". 

Being from 2002, It's one of the last 996's to be produced therefore benefiting from:
- Marchesini wheels (introducing a new five-spoke scheme)
- Front forks were being titanium nitrided to reduce stiction. 
- Rear shock absorber change from a Showa to Öhlins.

The bike is currently registered in Germany. Has a recent service/inspection and current TUV. and is ready to go.
