header: A usable Ducati 996 that needs to be ridden. 
quote: The 916 presented in 1994 was matched to the 996cc superbike factory racer from 1999, Carl Fogarty won the 1998 superbike world title on this bike. The Ducati 996 was born. With several improvements and about 10 hp more than the 916, this is again a super sports machine. According to many it is the most beautiful bike ever built and already a true classic. But more than that, it's a pleasure to drive. Great roadholding and razor sharp steering characterise the 996.

For Sale to ride and enjoy a Ducati 996

The bike is in a used condition but is a good example of a 996 to ride out and have fun on. 

It not only sounds amazing, it starts well, runs, drives, steers and brakes as it should.

The bike was purchased in Holland but it is currently registered in Germany.

It has been used a lot less than expected and as a result is looking for a new home where it can be appreciated and enjoyed.

The bike came to me with little history and information. Due to this and the KM of the bike (57k) I invested quite a lot of time and money to improve it to the standard that it should have been - some of the work including: 
- Full Service
- Lubricants and auxiliaries, sealing rings, gaskets, various screws, nuts etc. 
- Oil/filter change (Motul 300V Factory 15W50)
- Petrol Filter
- Air Filter (Pipercross performance)
- Spark plugs (CHAMPION RA59GC)
- Coolent change (MOTUL Motocool)
- Timing Belt
- New tyres, Michelin Pilot Power, front (120/70ZR17 and rear 1(80/55ZR17)
- Fork Seals
- BOS silencer insert 748-998

The bike is 20 years old and as to be expected shows some signs of “wear and tear“ as you would expect for its age, mileage and usage. The upper faring has some slight damage but an extra faring is included as part of the sale!

The bike has some nice features including Termignoni (carbon) pipes (including a DB Killer that can be removed), adjustable break shift set with reversed shift, Brembo brakes and an Ohlins rear shock. The bike has also had a conversion to a monoposto making it more appealing and looking more sporty.

As a 2002 model it was one of the last 996’s to be produced and therefore benefits from five spoke Marchesini wheels - titanium nitrided front forks to reduce stiction - and as mentions, an Ohlins rear shock.

The bike is registered in Germany, has a recent service/inspection, has TUV and is therefore ready to go.
